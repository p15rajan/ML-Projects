An airline passenger satisfaction survey refers to a type of market research that gathers feedback and information from passengers who have completed a trip with your airline or at your airport.
Typically, a survey is sent a short while after the trip in an effort to learn more about the passenger’s flying experience.As with any market research that is conducted, defining the goals and objectives of the study is the number one priority.
Before discussing things like price, timelines, or question types, a research team needs to know the survey goals and how the results will be used. Without clear objectives, you’re just shooting in the dark.
